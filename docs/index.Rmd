# What is FishSimGTG?

**FishSimGTG** is an R package that conducts numerical modeling of fish populations, including management strategy evaluation (MSE) and is an age-structured model that represents multiple concurrent cohorts using the growth-type-group methodology [@walters_fisheries_2004]. This framework is typically used to quantify trade-offs among competing management strategies or management options in terms of expected achievement of fishery management objectives. These trade-offs emerge from modeling results that are obtained from analysis methods like management strategy evaluation (MSE) or population dynamics projection. Calculation of trade-offs can play a meaningful role in supporting the development fishery management plans and fishery rule making. Simulations are implemented in the R statistical computing environment [@r_core_team_r_2022]. This framework is not a ‘black box’ software, and thus, it is intended to be customized to address specific questions related to fishery management.

## Installation and required packages

**FishSimGTG** is coded in R [@r_core_team_r_2022] and requires some basic packages that can be installed as follows:

1. **Install R**:

   - Go to the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/).
   - Download and install the appropriate version of R for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Install RStudio**:

   - Go to the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
   - Download and install RStudio Desktop (free version).
   
3. **Installing Required Packages**:

The user can install the necessary packages to run the simulation and visualize the outputs by using the following R commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

devtools::install_github("natureanalytics-ca/fishSimGTG")
devtools::install_github("natureanalytics-ca/fishSimTools")
```

The `devtools` package is necessary because it allows us to install these core packages directly from GitHub, ensuring we have the latest versions and updates.

4. **Load the Required Packages**:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(fishSimGTG)
library(fishSimTools)
```

The core packages required to run the simulation are `fishSimGTG` and `fishSimTools`. 
## How to use FishSimGTG?

The **FishSimGTG** package can be used to construct an operating model (OM) that simulates population and fishery dynamics, including data collection and the application of user-customized management procedures. The OM consists of several S4-type objects, such as the `LifeHistory` object, `Fishery` object, and `TimeArea` object, etc. These objects store parameters and information in slots, which users can access using the `@` symbol.

This user guide provides a full description of the S4 object components and instructions on how to populate each object to create the OM.
