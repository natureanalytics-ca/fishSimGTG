# Management Procedures (MPs)

A Management Procedure (MP) is a pre-agreed process defining how a fishery will be managed, with the primary role being to take fishery information and return a management recommendation. One of the most distinctive features of **FishSimGTG** is that it allows the user to create customized MPs. 

The **FishSimGTG** package can be used to make forward-projections for a variety of fishery management actions. Making forward projections requires the following set of S4-type objects. As previously discussed, the OM is comprised of three required objects in S4 format:

- Life history object (`LifeHistoryObj`)
- Historical fishery object (`HistFisheryObj`)
- Time-area object (`TimeAreaObj`)

With optional:

- Stochastic object (`StochasticObj`)

And, producing forward-simulation requires two additional objects in S4 format:

- Management procedure or harvest strategy object (`StrategyObj`)
- Projection time period fishery object (`ProFisheryObj`)

## Strategy object

The `StrategyObj` holds a set of instructions about how the fishery will be managed.

To create a new object of class `StrategyObj`, use the `new()` function.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
StrategyObj<-new("Strategy")
```

The user can see the elements or slots of the `StrategyObj` using the `slotNames()` function.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
slotNames(StrategyObj)
```

To populate the `StrategyObj`, the user should start by specifying a title (`title`) and the number of forward projection years to simulate (`projectionYears`).

The `projectionName` is a string that directs to a named function that contains a set of instructions about how the fishery will be managed. And, `projectionParams` is a list of input parameters that follows the specifications of the projection function defined in `projectionName`.

Developing the necessary code to create a custom `StrategyObj` can be very challenging. A `StrategyObj` can take the form of a simple projections or an MP. A simple projection differs from an MP in that projections consist of 'static' actions such as a size limit or constant fishing effort, whereas MPs are 'dynamic' actions such as annual adjustments to catch limits. MPs tend to be more complicated because they include a harvest control rule or decision-rule that is informed by updated information gathered from monitoring.  

In subsequent sections of this chapter, we will build example MPs. The user is advised to first explore Projection Modeling, in which simple projections are demonstrated using built-in functions. Understanding simple projections is a useful pre-cursor to understanding how to design and implement code for more complex MPs.


## Projection fishery object

The `ProFisheryObj` is an S4 object of the class `Fishery` that holds fishery characteristics, including vulnerability, retention, and discard information. Note that both the `HistFisheryObj` and 
`ProFisheryObj` utilize the same S4 object class. 

`HistFisheryObj` and `ProFisheryObj` are both `Fishery` objects. When no changes in the fishery characteristics are anticipated, the slots of `ProFisheryObj` can be set to the same values as those in `HistFisheryObj`

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
ProFisheryObj<-HistFisheryObj
```

Alternatively, the user has the option to modify the `HistFisheryObj` object when performing fishery projections. These modifications are stored in a new `ProFisheryObj`.

To create a new object of class `Fishery`, use the `new()` function, as follows:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
ProFisheryObj<-new("Fishery")
```

The slot names of the `ProFisheryObj` can be seen using the `slotNames()` function.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
slotNames(ProFisheryObj)
```

The user can access the help file using `?` symbol

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
?`Fishery-class`  
```

`ProFisheryObj` can be populated as follows:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
ProFisheryObj@title<-"Test"
ProFisheryObj@vulType<-"logistic"
ProFisheryObj@vulParams<-c(10.2,0.1)
ProFisheryObj@retType<-"logistic"
ProFisheryObj@retParams <- c(15, 0.1)
ProFisheryObj@retMax <- 1
ProFisheryObj@Dmort <- 0
```

In this example, during the projections, we maintain the same vulnerability type and parameters as in the `HistFisheryObj` object but modify retention to follow a logistic function.

### Uncertainty in the projection fishery

Additional slots in the `StochasticObj` object allow for modifications to the fishery projection object. These additional slots, `proFisheryVul_list`, `proFisheryRet_list`, and `proFisheryDmort_list`, are lists where the number of list items corresponds to the number of areas (`TimeAreaObj@areas`). Each item in the list is a matrix with \(n\) columns and 2 rows, where the rows represent the minimum and maximum values for the parameters associated with each column \(n\).

When provided, these lists replace the `vulParams`, `retParams`, and `Dmort` slots in the fishery projections (`ProFisheryObj`). For `proFisheryVul_list` and `proFisheryRet_list`, the number of columns in the matrix align with the required inputs for `ProFisheryObj@vulType` and `ProFisheryObj@retType`. During each iteration, the model samples values from a uniform distribution within the specified range (i.e., between the min and max values defined in the rows), allowing for uncertainty in the parameters, independently for each area.

The final slots in the `StochasticObj` object are `sameFisheryVul`, `sameFisheryRet`, and `sameFisheryDmort`. Each slot contains a logical variable ("TRUE" or "FALSE"). If set to `TRUE`, the arguments of `StochasticObj` specified to replace arguments of the `HistFisheryObj` will also replace arguments of the `ProFisheryObj`. This option is provided so that, for a given iteration, identical values will be applied to both the historical and projection time periods.

When `StochasticObj@sameFisheryVul = TRUE`, values generated for histFisheryVul should be applied so that historical and projection parameter values are identical. TRUE also overrides any input in proFisheryVul_list

When `StochasticObj@sameFisheryRet = TRUE`, values generated for histFisheryRet should be applied so that historical and projection parameter values are identical. TRUE also overrides any input in proFisheryRet_list

When `StochasticObj@sameFisheryDmort = TRUE`, values generated for histFisheryDmort should be applied so that historical and projection parameter values are identical. TRUE also overrides any input in proFisheryDmort_list


## Projection Modeling

In this section, we examine simple projection of a static management action (e.g., constant fishing effort).

In this example, `projectionParams` is a list with four items. The first item is a vector of length `areas` containing bag limits (`bag`). To indicate no bag limit, use `-99`. The bag limit should be considered as the take per unit time (e.g., per day) and basically acts like a CPUE threshold.
   
The second item is a matrix with `nrows = projectionYears` and `ncols = areas` that contains value multipliers of the initial equilibrium fishing effort (`effort`). This allows for the projection of effort reductions and the establishment of marine reserves by setting effort to `0`.

The two final items are a vector of length `areas` containing CPUE (`CPUE`), along with a `CPUEtype`, which is defined as a character string (e.g., `retN` for retention in numbers).

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
StrategyObj@projectionYears <- 50
StrategyObj@projectionName<-"projectionStrategy"
StrategyObj@projectionParams<-list(bag = c(5, 5), effort = matrix(1:1, nrow=50, ncol=2, byrow = FALSE), CPUE = c(7,11), CPUEtype = 'retN')
```



## Running the projection and management strategy simulation

This section provides an example for the user on how to run projections using three management strategies that combine minimum size and bag limits.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
#Batch processing - 3 management strategies
stateLmin<-c(10.2, 12.7,  12.7)
stateBag<-c(20, -99, 20)
fileLabel<-c("Higher_option1", "Higher_option2", "Higher_option3")
projectionLabel<-c("Bag 20", "Min size 5 inch", "Bag 20 & min size 5 inch")
```

In this example, `stateLmin` is a vector containing three minimum sizes, and `stateBag` is a vector that contains three bag limits. To indicate no bag limit, use `-99`. `fileLabel` is a label for the file name, and `projectionLabel` defines the name for the strategy that will be evaluated.

To run the projection under the three different management strategies (i.e., "Bag 20", "Min size 5 inch", and "Bag 20 & Min size 5 inch"), we will use the `runProjection()`. 

In this example, we modify the retention parameters of the logistic function previously defined in `ProFisheryObj@retParams`. These parameters are now redefined as `ProFisheryObj@retParams <- c(stateLmin[sc], 0.1)`, using the pre-specified size limits (`stateLmin`).

Additionally, in the list structure of the `StrategyObj@projectionParams`, the elements of the `bag` vector are replaced by the specified bag limits (`stateBag`).

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
for(sc in 1:NROW(stateLmin)){

  #Size limit - changes retention, not selectivity
  ProFisheryObj@retParams<-c(stateLmin[sc],0.1)

  #Bag limit
StrategyObj@projectionParams<-list(bag = c(stateBag[sc], stateBag[sc]), effort = matrix(1:1, nrow=50, ncol=2, byrow = FALSE), CPUE = c(7,11), CPUEtype = 'retN')

  runProjection(LifeHistoryObj = LifeHistoryObj,
                TimeAreaObj = TimeAreaObj,
                HistFisheryObj = HistFisheryObj,
                ProFisheryObj_list = list(ProFisheryObj, ProFisheryObj),
                StrategyObj = StrategyObj,
                StochasticObj = StochasticObj,
                wd = here("data-test", "Kole"),
                fileName = fileLabel[sc],
                doPlot = TRUE,
                titleStrategy = projectionLabel[sc]
  )
}
```

The `runProjection()` function contains several arguments. The objects `LifeHistoryObj`, `TimeAreaObj`, `HistFisheryObj`, `ProFisheryObj_list`, and `StrategyObj` were defined above. Among these, `LifeHistoryObj`, `TimeAreaObj`, and `HistFisheryObj` are required. The objects `StochasticObj`, `ProFisheryObj_list`, and `StrategyObj` are optional; however, `ProFisheryObj_list` should be used when `StrategyObj` is specified.

The function requires `ProFisheryObj` to be entered as a list, allowing the user to modify vulnerability, retention, and discard scenarios during the projection phase across different areas.

The `wd` argument is required and sets the working directory where the outputs of the projection will be saved. In this example, "Kole" is a subfolder of "data-test," so all plots will be stored in "Kole."

The `fileName` argument specifies the output file name and can be set to the `fileLabel` defined above. This argument is always required.

The `doPlot` argument is a logical value indicating whether to produce diagnostic plots upon completing simulations. The default is `FALSE` (no plots).

The `titleStrategy` argument describes the title for the management strategy being evaluated and can be set to the `projectionLabel`.

To explore all the arguments of this function, the user can use `?ProFisheryObj`.

Next, we present some of the plots produced by `runProjection()`.

```
